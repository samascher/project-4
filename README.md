# Summited!

The easiest way to keep a log of peaks you've climbed, along with getting the weather forecast for Colorado's 14,000+ ft peaks.

## Overview 

The home page presents a list of the Colorado 14ers. Clicking on one of these will take you to the page for that mountain. 

Once on the mountain page, the user can create, edit, update, or delete a date they climbed/summited the mountain. They can also provide a total hike time. The current weather is also presented with the option to show the extended forecast, in addition to a detailed forecast in 3 hour increments. 

This project was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It uses the [Weatherbit.io API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) to pull in the current & forecasted weather.
